# **Restaurant Review Analysis Using NLP**  

This project implements a **restaurant review classifier** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. Built in **Jupyter Notebook (Python 3.9)**, it applies machine learning models to analyze user reviews and determine sentiment.  

## **Overview**  
Customer reviews play a crucial role in decision-making for both businesses and customers. This project utilizes **machine learning** and **NLP** to process and classify restaurant reviews, helping businesses gain insights from customer feedback.  

## **Key Features**  
âœ… Preprocesses text using **NLTK** (stopword removal, tokenization, lemmatization)  
âœ… Converts text into numerical features using **TF-IDF** and **CountVectorizer**  
âœ… Implements multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, etc.)  
âœ… Evaluates performance with accuracy metrics and hyperparameter tuning  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python 3.10**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** for text preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms  
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data handling  

## **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raufmirzayee/Restaurant-review-using-NLP.git
   cd Restaurant-review-using-NLP
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model.  

## **Usage**  
- Load the dataset (`Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`).  
- Run the notebook to preprocess text and train models.  
- Evaluate different models and optimize performance.  

## **Results**  
The trained model can effectively classify customer reviews into **positive** or **negative** categories with high accuracy.
